Typhon
======

[Typhon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhon), is a script to set up a Mac OS X laptop for Wistia development.

Much of what follows is based on [Laptop](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop), a similar installer devised by the awesome folks at [Thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com/).

First Steps
------------

1) Install XCode, and the Command Line Tools for Xcode [more info](http://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/)

2) While that is installing, [download iTerm2](http://iterm2.com).

3) Open iTerm2, and Set zsh as your login shell. (After running command, close and re-open iTerm2)
        
        chsh -s /bin/zsh

Install
-------

Run the script:

    zsh < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/jeffvincent/typhon/master/build)

What it sets up
---------------

* Ack for finding things in files
* Bundler gem for managing Ruby libraries
* Foreman gem for serving Rails apps locally
* Heroku gem for interacting with the Heroku API
* Heroku Config plugin for local `ENV` variables
* Homebrew for managing operating system libraries
* ImageMagick for cropping and resizing images
* Postgres for storing relational data
* Postgres gem for talking to Postgres from Ruby
* Qt for headless JavaScript testing via Capybara Webkit
* Rails gem for writing web applications
* Ruby stable for writing general-purpose code
* RVM for managing versions of the Ruby programming language
* SSH public key for authenticating with Github and Heroku
* Tmux for saving project state and switching between projects

It should take less than 15 minutes to install (depends on your machine).
